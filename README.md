My project is a unit converter that converts between Imperial and Metric units.
It works for units that measure distance, temperature and weight.

I based the project off of google's MyFirstApp tutorial and A LOT of googling.
Shout out to Stack overflow for being the best website ever.

I found these links particularly helpful and took code from some of them
